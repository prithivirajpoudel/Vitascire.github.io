    <p>So, what did I learn up to this point? Am I just reading the book or do I even. implement this in life? I will definitely do that.</p>
     <p>Up to now the books talks about the importance of habit. Small habits or so called atomic habits can change our life. Habits forms identity and identity forms habits. We all have dream of becoming someone and first of all, we need to ask ourself who we want to be? let's take a example. I want to be a scientists then what do scientists do or who they are. They are person who learns consistently and  implement it. So I need to be consistent..
     This is identity based habit rather 'scientists' is outcome based. So, we need more to focus on identity How identity forms..? Identity forms by repeated or from experience.If we write a Page our identity is as of writer.If we go to gym our identity is as of athlete. So habits makes our identity.</p>
    <p>We shouldn't focus on result or outcome rather on a system. System consists of habits and repeated action that lead us to a desire destination . 
    Efforts requires requires patience to get outcome. If ice cube is kept in the table then, when the room temp increase by 1°C, 26°C to 27°C but the ice doesn't melts, again 27°C to 28°C no melting, 28°C to 29°C no melting but when 29°C to 30°c the ice starts to melts.The last 1°C increase is not the cause of melling of ice. The action before it were stored and up to a point there is no change  but crossing that point is termed as critical point by the writer or critical threshold.</p>
    <p>Now, the book talks about how to build a habit. Ok, lets summerise it. Habits are
   repeated actions. When a new thing arrives our brain wanders and thinks care carefully and we act very consiously and check every angle possible. But when we repeat the same thing the brain follows the same path and BOOM we get rewards. Gradually unecessary path fades away and only the useful ones remains and brain follows that, only. For eg:- when we stress and your brains search here and there
  wanders what may make you feel better and let suppose video games and you tried for first time and it instantly reduces Your stress level and it is consider as
   reward. When the next time you stress out your brain automatically make you to grab the controller and play the game. And then the habit is formed
   Habit formation is easy nah ??</p>
   <h2>Beliefs</h2>
   <p>Our habits can be changed in three ways:</p>
   <p>-Outcome based</p>
<p>-Identity based</p> 
<p>-Process based</p>
<p>Many people begin the process of changing  their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to out come-based habits. The alternatives is to build identity. based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.

But how can identity be formed? First of all what means identity. Your identity emerges out of habits. Your identity is literally Your "repeated beingness" Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it.
Taking example if you person having a identity of gamer. Then the proof of it would you have won many games that you have played. Let's take the we took before, of scientists. If you wanna be scientists and your identity. If you are consistant enough and research.</p>
