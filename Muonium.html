    <p>Muonium is an exotic atom that consists of an antimuon and an electron. It is similar to a hydrogen atom, which consists of a proton and an electron, but with the proton replaced by an antimuon. The antimuon has the same mass as an electron but has opposite charge (+1 instead of -1).</p>

<p>The formation of muonium can occur when a muon, which is a negatively charged subatomic particle similar to an electron but with a much greater mass, takes the place of an electron in an atom. The muon can then bind with another electron to form muonium.</p>

<p>Muonium is unstable and has a very short lifetime of about 2.2 microseconds, after which it decays into a neutrino and an antineutrino. Despite its short lifetime, muonium has been studied extensively in experiments because it provides a unique tool for investigating the fundamental properties of matter, such as the behavior of subatomic particles and the nature of the fundamental forces that govern their interactions.</p>

<h2>***Is muonium lighter than hydrogen*** ?</h2>

<p>The mass of a muonium atom is slightly less than the mass of a hydrogen atom. This is because the antimuon in muonium has a mass that is slightly less than the mass of a proton in hydrogen. The mass of a hydrogen atom is approximately 1.0079 atomic mass units (amu), while the mass of a muonium atom is approximately 0.1134 amu. However, it is important to note that both hydrogen and muonium have very low masses compared to most other atoms, and their masses are typically expressed in terms of atomic mass units (amu) rather than in grams or kilograms</p>
