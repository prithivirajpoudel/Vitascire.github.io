    <h1 class="header">Electricity don't travels from wire </h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="elec.png" alt="Image"></div>
    <p>The method that electrons travel the wire in the circuit from the battery to the light build or some electrical device but the concept we have been taught in school and collages and most of the universities is misunderstood and mis-conceptualized. Actually we are been taught the wrong methods and many students questions about it. I also had those questions in my mind troubling for years.</p>
<p>--> How can electron moves just so freely by jumping from atom to atom. </p>
<p>-->The speed or the drift velocity of electron is just so so small that for it to travel the whole simple circuit requires a long time. But when we click the switch, immediately the bulb turns ON , how ?? (the drift velocity of electron is about 0.01mm/sec)</p>
<p>-->If the electron moves on the circuit or the energy transfers through the electrons , how can electricity travels in the transformer or any type of gaps in the circuit , whether there is no physical object in the transformer but also the energy/ electricity travels.</p>

<p>The core misconception, propagated by many text books, is that moving electrons (or some other form of current) in the connecting wires carry energy from the battery to the electrical device. Here are some reasons why electrons doesn't carry the energy( electricity) </p>
<p>1.Electrons are just too slow to carry the energy fast enough! A 1mm copper wire carrying a current of 100 mA the answer turns out to be about 0.01 mm.s-1 and if that the case for turning a light bulb would take forever.(here I am talking about the drift velocity , actually electron travels faster but in random direction)</p>
<p>2.If the electrons were the one who travel through wire or the energy travelling through wire Than how electrons passes from the gap of the transformer</p>
<h2>Than How the heck the electricity travels in the speed of light? </h2>
<p>The energy actually is created by the electric field which creates the wirgling movement of the electron and electron than collides with the other atoms and transfer all of its energy to the atom , then due to the collision and energy transfer light and heat is produced. So definitely electron doesn't carry the energy from the battery all the way to the bulb , its the electro-magnetic field which creates the movement in the electrons of the bulb and then it collides with the atom to release light energy.</p>
<h2>But how is the electric field created?</h2>
<p>Battery ?? partially it is correct but its not only the battery that creates the field. Also the wire connected to it creates the filed inside the wire and also create the electric filed space around the wires due to the surface charges created by the wire. </p>
<h2>But a question may arise how the charge is distributed?</h2>
<p>By the movement of electrons? definitely not. These surface charge is created almost instantaneously only limiting by the speed of light. And then the work of the battery comes. It works continuously to maintain the electric field by moving the electrons. So the battery is putting energy into the field and field is carrying it up to the electric device( let take example light bulb) and the electrons is accelerated by this electric fields and than electrons collide. 
First of all when circuit is open than the surface charges creates the electric field and the but the electric field inside the wire is zero as no electrons are moving but as soon we close the circuit the electric field is no longer 0 and electron starts to move. And the electric field moves outside the wire to the bulb at the speed of light and when it reaches the bulb then the electrons on the bulb start to accelerate and dissipate energy on the atoms to produce light energy. The actual time taken to glow the bulb is determined by the speed of the electro-magnetic field to reach the bulb and the distance between them , not the length of wire or the drift velocity of the electrons. </p>
<p>(atom means the metal ions present on the resistive wire in the bulb , so don't get confused )</p>
